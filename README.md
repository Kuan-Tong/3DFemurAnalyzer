# 3DFemurAnalyzer
This repository contains the implementation of an improved **Scaling Iterative Closest Point (SICP)** algorithm for precise local registration of femoral point cloud models. Additionally, it includes a **Statistical Shape Model (SSM)** based on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and an interactive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for segmentation and morphological analysis of femoral fractures in 3D images.
## Key Features
**Improved SICP Algorithm:** Enables high-precision global and local registration with anisotropic scaling for femoral point clouds.

**SSM with PCA:** Constructs a shape model to analyze variations in femoral morphology.

**Interactive GUI:** Provides precise semantic segmentation based on clustering of shape features in complex femoral structures.
